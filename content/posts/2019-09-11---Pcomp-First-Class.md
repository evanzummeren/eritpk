**This post describes the first week of phyisical computation,** it contains a mindmap containing different types of concepts related to electricity, a recap on two interaction design texts and a reflection of how some of the new populistic movements are inspired by forms of physical computation.

## Electricity

It's been a while since I've been in high school. So although most electricity concepts are somewhat vaguely familiar, I still thought it was best to make some kind of mindmap around it. I should probably print it and hang it above my bed.

## Interaction Design

This week we've been reading the first two chapters of *[The Art of Interactive Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/981377.The_Art_of_Interactive_Design)* by Chris Crawford and *[A brief rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)* by Bret Victor.

### A quick recap on Crawford (chapter 1 and 2)

According to Crawford *interactivity isn't a boolean*, it's not a black and white thing, but there are rather **degrees of interactivity**. In interactivity there are always two actors. Just responding to a physical object, even if it's a really mind blowing book, isn't interactivity. 

Interactivity is like a conversation. You are **listening**, **thinking** and **speaking**. Everything is in balance. No step can be skipped or underperforming.

Interactivity has existed for millions of years, it's just that automated interactivity is a new thing. It's superior to any other form of human expression: "[..] interactivity wraps it's tentacles around our mind and doesn't let go".

Crawford shows himself as a real apostle for interactivity. In a somewhat dated argument Crawford tells that it's the interactivity that sets the personal computer apart from any other medium (as the quality of a VHS is superior to that of an early 2000's avi compression).

What caused the computer revolution in the 80's is interactivity. Computers existed way before then, but they we're clunky and unaccesible. The most important part in that revolution is software and the interactivty that empowers users.

### An even quicker recap on Victor

In *A brief rant on the Future of Interaction Design*, Bret Victor writes about the limited imagination of how our future interfaces  look like in our popular culture. These visions often show the future with interfaces that are still very flat and screen-like. It's a vision wherin the future only show a small increase of the current status quo.

According to Victor a tool addresses the human needs by amplifying human capabilities. There are only a couple of object where a interaction with a flat surface is desirable (for instance turning a paper).

In all the other interfaces an interaction with a real 3d object is much more desirable. Interaction with a 3d object truly uses all the capabilities of the human body.

The interaction we have with real physical objects eventually come down to four fundamental grips: A power grip (fingers vs palm), a precision grip (fingers vs thumb), a hook grip (between phalanges) and a scissor grip (between fingers)

## The Brexit guy and physical computation for political decision-making [WIP]

A couple of weeks ago I was reading a blog post by [Dominic Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cummings), who was the campaign director behind the Brexit campaign and a confidant to current British PM Boris Johnson. 

In a lengthy [blog post](https://dominiccummings.com/2019/06/26/on-the-referendum-33-high-performance-government-cognitive-technologies-michael-nielsen-bret-victor-seeing-rooms/) Cummings describes how much of our current decision making in politics haven't changed that much. He takes a great deal of his inspiration from Bret Victor and Michael Nielsen.

To be honest, I think the ultimate goal people such as Cummings or Jacob Rees-Mogg is to make the government as small as possible. I might be a bit too pessimistic in this, but for me Brexit has always felt as a way to turn the government into a libertarian 

The interface Cummings is proposing feels to me like a tools to do so. It's in essence a very quantitative, McNamara, approach to politics.

I think people as Cummings and Steve Bannon have done the world  more harm than good. But one thing I do find fascinating about them for is their understanding of the zeitgeist, or at least their willingness to understand them. I can't imagine any labour or christian
