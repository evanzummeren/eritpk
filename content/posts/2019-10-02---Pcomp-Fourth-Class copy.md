This week I spent most of my Pcomp time learning some practical skills. I spent more time learning how to solder than I actually wanted to. I also connected a potentiometer and a small microphone as an analog input and a servo motor as a PMW output.

## Soldering

Soldering is actually more difficult than I thought. I messed up a board pretty bad, and I had to desolder it, which was a big pain. Along the way I did learn some tricks. For instance once you're able to remove the pinheads, there is still some solder inside the pins. You can use a *solder sucker* tool for this. The best way it worked for me is to heat up the solder on one side and put the sucker behind it.

## Analog input, PMW output

Practicing with analog inputs and PMW/digital outputs. Nothing fancy.
