# Design analysis
In this design analysis I went with one of the posters of Dutch graphic designer Wim Crouwel, who passed away earlier this month. Grids are a big part of his work and in some of his work the grid even remains clearly visible. For Crouwel grids weren't just part of his graphic design work: 'I always have the tendency to put all the items on a table straight. Every time I see something that is off, I will put it straight. It's a doleful habit, but I have once decided on doing this.'

## The grid system

I decided on using the 'beeldje voor beeldje' (image per image) poster, which was made for an exhibition taking place on 1974 in the Stedelijk Museum. The exhibition is about animation and the poster is therefor quite clever. It's showing portionds of five different frames, and because every frame is getting a little smaller it also shows speed.

The grid is a little off. I can imagine that there is probably a more refined grid underneath this (maybe just squares). It could also be a little off because of the fact that it's a scan, but also because it's handdrawn by Crouwel. One of the museum conservators at the Stedelijk notes that they once tried to replicate one of Crouwel's posters with a computer, but that it became 'a complete failure'. Not sure if this is an 'aura of the original'-argument, but actually I do nottice that being completely true to a grid can also be quite restraining.

Here's an animation.

Note the hierarchy of elements within that system. Identify the number and variation of typefaces and the variety represented within a single type family.

Look at the palette and identify the color system.
