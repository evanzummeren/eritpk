## What do you do?

Ever since I came to the United States I often have similar conversations. What's your name? Where do you come from? What do you do? Of course I often had these conversations back in the Netherlands, but moving to a new place where I barely know a soul increased these conversations by a tenfold.

The 'What do you do' is the one I hate the most. Partially because I wear so many hats that no answer feels very satisfying. It would be much easier to reply: 'I am a doctor' or 'I work as a lawyer'.

However the 'What do you do' also defines people. The work we do is a large, maybe even the most important part, of the identity that we carry. If you are unhappy with the office job that you currently have, you try aspire something bigger.

In the film Serpico (1973) this is nicely visible. Serpico (Al Pacino) vists a party where he is introduced to a couple of people. All the people Serpico is introduced too are actually doing a work

In that sense it was also an important part of the class discussions that we had. Many people felt that they were stuck in jobs and they aspired to do something that has more value.

## The work journey
For the work journey I have been exploring a couple of different concepts (see notes for sketches). What I eventually found the most intr

I am curious towards the visual culture that are associated with these jobs. The ones we dream about as a kid are probably the ones that are visually quite intrueging. While the jobs we have difficulties explaining in words, are possibly also difficult to explain to images.

However, time is also an important part of the visuals. Just like the country someone is coming from. For instance an astronaut in the 60's (moon landing) has a different visual culture than one in the 80's (space shuttle). Just like a kosmonaut (a Russian astronaut) has very different visuals.

In a sense is that what we aspire to become, a storytelling trap that we fell into? The things that we aspire are the ones that might contain clear narratives and visuals.

## Creating the work journey
I want to create a video that shows the visual culture that are associated with the jobs that we do and that we aspire to become.
To do that I will do an automated Google Image search on the profession plus the year the person (e.g. fireman + 1995) was dreaming or actually doing this. I wrote a small script to make this a little easier. 

To make the emotions and actions of the people visible I want to record a small interview with both myself and the others and lay these on top of key moments.

### Step 1: Interviewing and filling in a spreadsheet
I tried to break up work/career journey is a couple of categories/questions to cover the entire:

* What did you want to become? [dreams]
* What did you do? [reality]
* What do you do? [reality]
* What do you want to do? [dreams]

### Step 2: Writing a script to perform the Google Image search
I will use Google Puppeteer for this.

### Step 3: Importing this stuff in After Effects
