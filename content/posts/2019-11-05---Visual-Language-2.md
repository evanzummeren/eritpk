# Ticket

To make the story more linear I limited the width by using the ticket vertically. This way every rule contains either one or two bits of information. There are two blocks in between. The first block referring to the time spent on the airport and the second part referring to the trip itself. There is a small intersection in between which refers to the time where the passengers has to find it's seat. This part could be explored more further, for instance by even symbolising the row where the person has to sit, or indicating whether the passenger is sitting next to the window or the aisle.

I used a serif in the heading to make it stand out more between the other two sans serif's. All of the other letters are in sans. I used the bottom of the ticket for all the information that isn't useful for the passengers, but which is intended for airline personnel.

## Logo's

For the logo's I went with the words *fish*, *cup* and *death*. I think the fish one is my favourite. The first *F* is a fish, the *i* a hook and the *s* an (apparently European) ale. The second logo is a cup. The u is a broken cup, the c is the ear of the cup. It could probably use a couple of design iterations as it looks a little dated now. The third logo resembles death. The letters are fading, but the fine etching are trying to keep the shape, or the person, alive.
